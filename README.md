🚀 Fraud Detection using AI & MLflow  

📌 Overview  

This project implements an AI-powered fraud detection system for banking transactions using machine learning. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and monitoring using **MLflow** for experiment tracking.  

🔧 Setup Instructions  
1️⃣ Clone the Repository  

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fraud-detection-ai.git  
cd fraud-detection-ai  
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

### 3️⃣ Run Jupyter Notebook  
```bash
jupyter notebook  
```

### 4️⃣ Start MLflow for Experiment Tracking  
```bash
mlflow ui  
```
Open **http://localhost:5000** in your browser to view experiment logs.  

## 📊 How It Works  
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares transaction data.  
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracts key fraud detection features.  
3. **Model Training**: Uses machine learning to classify fraudulent transactions.  
4. **Experiment Tracking**: Logs training runs with MLflow.  
5. **Evaluation**: Visualizes fraud detection results and model performance.  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- **MLflow** (Experiment tracking)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Development)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Visualization)
